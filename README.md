# Sustainability Status of 6 Indian Companies

This repository contains data and analysis supporting a comprehensive review of the sustainability status of six major Indian companies. It includes reference data, Python code for generating key ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) parameter graphs, and company-level performance visualizations.

## Repository Structure

| File Name                | Purpose                                                                                       |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Data sheets.xlsx`       | Contains all reference tables manually prepared from the Integrated and BRSR reports of the six companies. This file serves as the primary data source for all analyses and visualizations. |
| `Parameter_Graphs.ipynb` | Python notebook with code to generate graphs for each ESG parameter, enabling parameter-wise analysis across companies and years. |
| `Scores_Graphs.ipynb`    | Python notebook with code to generate graphs of overall ESG scores for each company, supporting comparative and trend analysis.      |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or compatible environment
- Required Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn (see individual notebooks for details)

### Usage

1. **Review Data**
   - Open `Data sheets.xlsx` to examine the manually compiled reference tables for all six companies.

2. **Parameter Analysis**
   - Launch `Parameter_Graphs.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Run the notebook to generate visualizations for each ESG parameter.
   - Use these graphs to compare parameter-level performance and identify trends or outliers.

3. **Company Score Analysis**
   - Open `Scores_Graphs.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute the notebook to produce company-level ESG score graphs.
   - These visualizations support comparative analysis and highlight performance changes over time.

## Project Overview

This repository supports a detailed report on the sustainability performance of six Indian companies, focusing on:

- Data completeness and transparency
- ESG parameter trends and company-level scores
- Identification of sector strengths and areas for improvement

The data and code here enable reproducible analysis and facilitate further research or reporting on corporate sustainability.
